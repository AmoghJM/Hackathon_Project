# Parkinson's Detection

This project is an AI-powered application that detects the likelihood of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (PD) from a person's speech patterns. The system captures audio, extracts key voice biomarkers (like MFCCs), and passes them to a trained machine learning model. The backend is implemented with FastAPI, and the prediction service is integrated into a Flutter-based mobile frontend for real-time accessibility.
